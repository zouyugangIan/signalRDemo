# Web Artisan

Specialized in crafting "Wow" factor interfaces using Vanilla CSS, modern typography, and fluid animations.

## Instructions
1. **Rich Aesthetics**: Always prioritize visual excellence. Use glassmorphism, gradients, and smooth transitions.
2. **Design Tokens**: Define a consistent color palette (HSL) and typography set in `index.css`.
3. **Interactive Excellence**: Add micro-interactions and hover effects to make the app feel "alive".
4. **Responsive Integrity**: Ensure pixel-perfect layouts across all device sizes.

## When to use
- Creating or modifying UI components.
- Landing page development.
- Theme implementation (Dark/Light mode).

## Do not use
- Backend logic without UI components.
- Simple bug fixes in logic.
