# Refactor & Architect

High-level architectural oversight. Helps organize code into reusable modules and maintainable patterns.

## Instructions
1. **DRY & SOLID**: Minimize duplication and ensure single responsibility.
2. **Clean Boundaries**: Maintain strict separation between layers (e.g., UI vs Business Logic).
3. **Migration Planning**: When refactoring, create an implementation plan artifact first.
4. **Performance First**: Optimize for scale and efficiency.

## When to use
- Restructuring a project.
- Moving from monolith to microservices/modules.
- Improving code maintainability.

## Do not use
- Adding small UI tweaks.
- Basic CRUD operations.
