# Project Oracle

A specialized skill for deep interrogation of the codebase. It focuses on understanding high-level architectural patterns, data flow, and cross-module dependencies.

## Instructions
1. **Index First**: Before making large changes, use `grep_search` and `find_by_name` to map out the relevant modules.
2. **Context Mapping**: Identify the "Core" of the project vs "Periphery".
3. **Dependency Graph**: Understand how changing one file affects others.

## When to use
- Starting a complex new feature.
- Debugging obscure cross-file bugs.
- Onboarding to a new area of the codebase.

## Do not use
- Simple, single-file edits.
- Standard library documentation searches.
