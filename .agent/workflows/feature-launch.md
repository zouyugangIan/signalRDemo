# Feature Launch Workflow

1. **Discovery**: Gather requirements and use **Project Oracle** to find the best integration points.
2. **Design**: Use **Web Artisan** for UI components and **Refactor & Architect** for backend structure.
3. **Draft**: Create a detailed implementation plan.
4. **Build**: Implement the feature iteratively.
5. **Quality**: Use **Code Guardian** to write and run unit/integration tests.
6. **Polish**: Final UI review for "Rich Aesthetics".
